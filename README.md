# What is GitHub?

A place where a community can organize around code - or any text. Community members can make contributions to the codebase, discuss issues, organize knowledge, and make their own copies to build off independently.

## What does this look like?

# How does open source make sense?
## Isn't my code my whole business?

--

### #1: Give away code, sell support

Oracle and Redhat both follow this model.

--

### #2: Give away code, sell the platform

This one is slightly different and is the business model behind WordPress. You can host it yourself - or you can pay to have it hosted for you at WordPress.com (or get it for free with ads).

--

### #3: Give away code that's not central to your business

This isn't just being nice. It's being lazy in a smart way. If other people use your software, they'll help improve and maintain it.

Thoughtbot is a software consultancy with a [*ton* of open source projects](https://github.com/thoughtbot). They give these away because they're not a "Rails file upload management company" or a "SASS mixin library company" - these are just tools they use to make their real products. By sharing their tools with the world, they get free work and free advertising.

# Why Git?
## Why is all this open-source community goodness organized around Git?

There are  [a lot of reasons to use Git](http://thkoch2001.github.io/whygitisbetter/), but the short version is it:

1. Makes collaboration very easy
2. Is adaptable to any kind of work flow
3. Probably boasts the most big, open source projects - and is *overwhelmingly* favored in the Ruby world.

## How does Git work?
### (How do I learn to use it?)

I have a little demo we can do with Tinker Toys that I stole from a  [talk at Linux.conf.au](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4). I also recommend the following resources, to be consumed by beginners in this order:

1. [tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1): hand-holding introduction to Git made by Codeschool
2. [Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/): complete walkthrough of all the basics, from setting up a repository to all the everyday Git commands
3. [Visualizing Git Concepts with D3](http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/): great, interactive playground where you can see a visual representation of exactly what goes on under the hood
4. [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): great reference for any Git and even many GitHub questions you may have
